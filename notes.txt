Notes:

~ JSX is not a HTML inside javascript, JSX is a html like syntax, but not exactly html
~ for multiple elements react uses a key to uniquely identify each element "key is not a id in html"
~ working : React.createElement(tag) => object => HTML (DOM) (babel comverts this JSX into react object which is then rendered in HTML DOM)
~ JSX uses camelcasing similar to Js
~ Name of a component starts with Capital Letter (not mandatory but a good practice), the react element can be smaller case
~ We can write javascript code inside { } braces.


Few Things about JSX
- A jsx code can only have one parent
eg : const title = ()=>{
			<h2>HEllo</h2>  //this is incorrent
			<h3>masdkds</h3>
	}
	to use multiple element we should wrap it inside a <div> or <React.Fragment> or simply use empty tags (<> </>)(shorthand of react.fragment) to wrap the elements inside
	const title = ()=>{
			<React.Fragment> //now its valid
				<h2>Hello</h2>  
				<h3>masdkds</h3>
			</React.Fragment>
	}

- To give a style to a jsx element, we use style = {}, and define attributes inside {} , style takes object as argument in Js
	<div style={{backgroundColor:"red"}}></div>
	or 
	const styleobj = {background-color:"red"}
	<div style={styleobj}></div>
